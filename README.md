This is an Infinite Scroll Image Gallery created with the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I'm using React Hooks and [React Infinite Scroll Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component).

You can visit the Github project page [here](https://ioanacosmina.github.io/image-gallery/) to test the app or just clone the repository. If cloning the repo, you will need to add your own Unsplash API KEY.
